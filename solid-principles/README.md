## Solid Principles

### S - Single Responsibility Principle

We want classes & methods to have single responsibility, high cohesion and should be used for single usage, and re-use them much easier later on.

### O - Open Close Principle

When we write code, it should be open for extension but closed for modification.

### L - Liskov's Substitution Principle 

This means if you have objects of a class, you should be able to replace them with instances of thier sub-types / sub-classes, without altering the correctness of the program

### I - Interface Segregation Principle 

Overall, its better to have several specific interfaces as appose to one general purpose interface

### D - Dependency Inversion Principle 

It means that classes should depend on abstraction and not on concrete subclasses
